# NumPy arrays have a threshold size print option, such that when an
# array greater than that size is converted to a string, for printing,
# only the first few and last few elements are shown.  If the array is
# smaller than the threshold size, all the elements are printed out.
# (This setting makes no change to the actual array, but merely
# governs how the array is represented when a copy of the array is
# converted to a string.)  
#
# The default threshold size is 1000.  Here, the threshold size is
# changed to a much larger value as Sherpa often deals with large
# arrays.

[chips]
# If the plotting package is chips, set Sherpa-specific
# preferences here.  If plotting package is anything else,
# this section is completely ignored.  These preferences
# go into effect the first time a Sherpa plot function
# is called (*not* when Sherpa is started; chips is not
# imported until the first plot is made).
